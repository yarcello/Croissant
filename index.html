      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

        <div class="col-5">
          <strong>Ingredients</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 ¬Ω tsp salt</li>
            <li>50g sugar</li>
            <li>2 x 7g sachets fast-action dried yeast</li>
            <li>oil, for greasing</li>
            <li>300g butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-7">
          <div class="strong">STEP 1</div>
          <p>
            Put the flour, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Measure 300ml cold
            water into a jug, add the yeast and stir. Make a well in the flour
            and pour in the liquid. Mix, then knead on your work surface for 10
            mins. Shape into a ball, put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and
            chill for at least 2 hrs.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 2</div>
          <p>
            Put the butter between 2 sheets of baking parchment. Using a rolling
            pin, bash and roll it into a rectangle about 20 x 15cm. Leave
            wrapped in the baking parchment and chill.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 3</div>
          <p>
            Transfer the chilled dough to a floured surface and roll into a 40 x
            20cm rectangle. Place the unwrapped slab of butter in the centre of
            the dough, so that it covers the middle third.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 4</div>
          <p>Fold one side of the dough up and halfway over the butter.</p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 5</div>
          <p>
            Fold the other side of the dough up and over the butter in the same
            way, so that the two edges of the dough meet in the centre of the
            butter.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 6</div>
          <p>
            Fold the dough in half so that the point where the ends of the dough
            meet becomes the seam. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 7</div>
          <p>
            Repeat the rolling, folding and chilling process (steps 3-6) twice
            more in exactly the same way ‚Äì rolling the pastry while it‚Äôs still
            folded ‚Äì without adding more butter. Wrap and chill overnight.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 8</div>
          <p>
            The next day, roll the dough out on a floured surface into a large
            rectangle, measuring about 60 x 30cm. Using a sharp knife or pizza
            cutter, trim the edges to neaten.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 9</div>
          <p>
            Cut the dough in half lengthways so that you have 2 long strips,
            then cut each strip into 6 or 7 triangles with 2 equal sides.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 10</div>
          <p>
            Take each triangle in turn and pull the two corners at the base to
            stretch and widen it.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 11</div>
          <p>
            Starting at the base of each triangle, begin to gently roll into a
            croissant, being careful not to crush the dough.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 12</div>
          <p>
            Continue rolling, making sure the tip of each triangle ends up
            tucked under the croissant to hold in place. If adding any fillings
            (see tips, below), place across the widest part of the triangle
            before rolling up.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 13</div>
          <p>
            Bend the ends of the croissants inwards, then transfer to baking
            trays lined with baking parchment, spaced well apart. Cover with
            lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 2 hrs, or until
            doubled in size.
          </p>
          <div class="strong">STEP 14</div>
          <p>
            Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix the beaten egg with a pinch of
            salt and use to generously glaze the croissants. Bake for 15-18 mins
            until risen and golden brown, then cool on wire racks.
